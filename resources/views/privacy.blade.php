        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
        policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
        Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
      </p><br><p>
        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
        the collection and use of information in relation to this
        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
        used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
        anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p><br><p>
        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
        as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
        codewithnilaa unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
      </p><br>  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
        to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
        stored on your device's internal memory.
      </p><br> <p>
        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
        the app may use third party code and libraries that use
        “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
        You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
        and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
        choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
        portions of this Service.
      </p><br> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
        I may employ third-party companies and
        individuals due to the following reasons:
      </p><br> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
        I want to inform users of this Service
        that these third parties have access to your Personal
        Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
      </p><br> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
        I value your trust in providing us your
        Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p><br> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
        a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
        that these external sites are not operated by me.
        Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
        Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
        no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
        services.
      </p> <br><p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
        I do not knowingly collect personally
        identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
        I discover that a child under 13 has provided
        me with personal information, I immediately
        delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
        and you are aware that your child has provided us with
        personal information, please contact me so that
        I will be able to do necessary actions.
      </p><br><p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>

        time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will
        notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
        this page.
